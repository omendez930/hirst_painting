# Hirst Painting Using Turtle

In my journey of 100 days of python coding, in this project, I decided to recreate the infamous hirst painting of dots using the turtle library, and Turtle class.

# Libraries used

*random*

*colorgram*

*turtle*

By extracting the colors from an actual hirst painting, I was able to create a duplicate copy of the painting using randomly generated colors.
